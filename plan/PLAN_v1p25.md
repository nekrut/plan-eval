# Per-sample mtDNA amplicon variant-calling plan

1. **Set globals and prepare results directory**
   - Define `THREADS=4` and the sample list: `M117-bl M117-ch M117C1-bl M117C1-ch`.
   - Create `results/` if missing. Use `set -euo pipefail`.
   - Treat every output step as idempotent: guard each artifact with an existence check (e.g. skip if `results/{sample}.vcf.gz.tbi` already exists and is newer than its inputs). Re-runs on a fully populated `results/` must exit 0 without re-doing work.

2. **Reference indexing (once, in `data/ref/`)**
   - `samtools faidx data/ref/chrM.fa` → produces `chrM.fa.fai`.
   - `bwa index data/ref/chrM.fa` → produces the `.amb .ann .bwt .pac .sa` set.
   - Skip both if the index files already exist.

3. **Per-sample alignment with `bwa mem`**
   - Use `bwa mem -t 4` with the paired FASTQs `data/raw/{sample}_1.fq.gz` and `data/raw/{sample}_2.fq.gz`.
   - Pass the read group via `-R` as a single double-quoted argument containing literal backslash-t between fields and colons between key and value:
     - exact form: `-R "@RG\tID:{sample}\tSM:{sample}\tLB:{sample}\tPL:ILLUMINA"`
     - The `\t` must remain the two characters backslash and `t` — bwa parses them itself. Do NOT use `printf`, `echo -e`, `$'\t'`, or any mechanism that turns them into real tabs; bwa rejects real tabs with “the read group line contained literal <tab> characters”.
     - Separators between key and value are colons `:`, not `=`.

4. **SAM → sorted BAM**
   - Pipe `bwa mem` stdout into `samtools sort -@ 4 -o results/{sample}.bam`.
   - Do NOT run `markdup` or `rmdup`: this is amplicon data where PCR duplicates are expected and biologically meaningful.

5. **BAM indexing**
   - `samtools index -@ 4 results/{sample}.bam` → `results/{sample}.bam.bai`.

6. **Variant calling with `lofreq call-parallel`**
   - Exact command:
     ```
     lofreq call-parallel --pp-threads 4 -f data/ref/chrM.fa -o results/{sample}.vcf results/{sample}.bam
     ```
   - Output: `results/{sample}.vcf` (uncompressed). lofreq emits plain VCF.

7. **VCF compression and indexing**
   - Compress with `bgzip` (not `bcftools view -O z`) producing `results/{sample}.vcf.gz`.
   - Index with `tabix -p vcf results/{sample}.vcf.gz` → `results/{sample}.vcf.gz.tbi`.
   - Remove the intermediate uncompressed `.vcf`.

8. **Collapse step → `results/collapsed.tsv`**
   - For each sample, run `bcftools query -f '{sample}\t%CHROM\t%POS\t%REF\t%ALT\t%INFO/AF\n' results/{sample}.vcf.gz` (the `{sample}` literal is prepended via the format string so the sample name is attached per row).
   - Concatenate all four samples’ output.
   - Prepend a single header line `sample\tchrom\tpos\tref\talt\taf` (tab-separated).
   - Output is tab-separated, one variant per line, header on, written to `results/collapsed.tsv`. Rebuild only if any input VCF is newer than the TSV.

9. **Idempotency check**
   - Final pass: re-running the script on a fully populated `results/` exits 0, performs no work, and leaves all eight per-sample artifacts plus `collapsed.tsv` intact.
